contao-member-update-notification
=================================

Sends a notification e-mail to the administrator each time a member updates her / his profile.  
May be useful when your client needs to sync customer data manually with some CRM.

Please note: Your "Personal Data" module must have the "E-Mail" field implemented,  
otherwise the extension won't recognize any changes.

    Requirements: Contao 3.X
